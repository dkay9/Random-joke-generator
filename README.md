How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Used HTML for the structuring and CSS for the interface. Used JAVASCRIPT to grab some HTML elements for dom manipulation and I used the fetch function to send GET request to an api and retrieve data in json() which generates random jokes which I insert into the dom.

Lessons Learned:
I used this application to practice dom manipulation, how to make an api request and get a response in json and convert stringified json to an object. It was really cool to try all that out. Also I was able to handle the response I got from the api and get the data I wanted and also insert into the dom. I also practiced error handling with .catch().
