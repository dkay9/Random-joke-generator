How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I used HTML for the structuring and CSS for the interface. I used JAVASCRIPT to grab some HTML elements for DOM manipulation, and I used the fetch function to send a GET request to an API and retrieve data in JSON (), which generated random jokes I inserted into the DOM.

Lessons Learned:
I used this application to practice DOM manipulation, how to make an API request, get a response in JSON, and convert stringified JSON to an object. It was really cool to try all that out. I was also able to handle the response I got from the API, get the data I wanted, and insert it into the DOM. I also practiced error handling with .catch().
